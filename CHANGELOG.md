## [0.3.23]

- Patch update command.

## [0.3.22]

### Changed
- New architecture for `bugster destructive` unblocking longer executions.

## [0.3.21]

### Added
- Initial monorepo support
  - Works with most monorepo setups including basic Turborepo configurations
  - Detects changes in individual apps within the monorepo
  - Note: Currently does not track changes in shared packages (e.g., common components installed via pnpm in each app's node_modules)

### Changed
- `bugster generate` default settings. You can execute it multiple times, without having to add --force explicitly.
- Improved test generation intelligence: both `bugster generate` and `bugster update` now analyze existing test specs context to avoid creating duplicate or similar tests


## [0.3.20]

### Changed
- Force chromium installation on install script
- Remove the question loop on credentials during `bugster init`

## [0.3.19]

### Changed
- The `--page` flag in `bugster generate` now accepts relative or absolute file paths instead of page folder names. This provides more flexibility and control over which pages are analyzed.
- Added validation for the `--page` flag to ensure that provided paths exist, are files, and have valid JavaScript/TypeScript extensions (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`).

## [0.3.15] - 2025-06-26

### Added
- Added `--stream-results` as the default behaviour for `bugster run`
- Added `--max-concurrent = 5` as the default behaviour for `bugster run`
- Added `--page` for command `bugster generate` for spec generation of a specific page or set of pages.
- Added `--count` option for `bugster generate` to control the number of test specs generated per page (min: 1, max: 30)


## [0.3.14] - 2025-06-26

### Added
- Added Vercel protection bypass to  `bugster destructive`

## [0.3.13] - 2025-06-26

### Added
- Added `run_id` to  `bugster destructive` for test run association

## [0.3.12] - 2025-06-26

### Added
- Added `bugster destructive`, our new agent for raising bugs.

## [0.3.11] - 2025-06-25

### Added
- Added `preferences` section to the configuration file.
- Added `always_run` option to select up to 3 specs that will always run.

## [0.3.10] - 2025-06-24

### Changed
- Improved `bugster generate` architecture, resulting in a 30% speed increase.

## [0.3.9] - 2025-06-23

### Added
- Added `vercel-bypass-automation` support: you can now use the secret within Bugster config while keeping your branch protected

## [0.3.7] - 2025-06-19

### Added
- Enhanced `bugster generate` specs generation capacity up to 20 specs for comprehensive coverage

### Changed
- Improved specs generation algorithm for better coverage and more realistic test scenarios


## [0.3.6] - 2025-06-19

### Added
- `bugster issues` command to get failed runs with debugging context from recent executions
- `bugster upgrade` command to update CLI to the latest version directly from the command line

### Changed
- Improved specs generation algorithm for better coverage and more realistic test scenarios

### Fixed
- Small bug of the console message during `bugster init`

## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-13

### Added
- `--only-affected` flag for `bugster run` to execute only specs affected by code changes
- `--max-concurrent` flag for `bugster run` supporting up to 5 parallel test executions
- Component-level tracking for `bugster update` command
- GitHub integration for running specs on Vercel preview deployments
- Cross-platform installer scripts for Windows, macOS, and Linux with automatic dependency management



### Changed
- Enhanced `bugster update` command now works at component granularity instead of file level
- Improved parallel test execution with better resource management
- Optimized change detection algorithm for more accurate affected test identification
- Rich console output with color-coded messages and progress indicators
- Enhanced error handling with detailed debugging information

### Fixed
- Performance improvements for large codebases with many components
- Better handling of component dependency tracking
- Reduced false positives in change detection

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-06

### Added
- `bugster sync` command to retrieve and manage test specs across different branches
- `bugster auth` command for secure API key management with GUI integration
- `bugster update` command to automatically update test specs when codebase changes
