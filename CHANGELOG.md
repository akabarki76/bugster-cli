# Changelog

All notable changes to Bugster CLI will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.30]

### Added
- `bugster config`  command
This command will be used to access and manipulate the data inside config.yaml ( so as to avoid human error)

Right now the only flag available is --bypass-protection. This will guide users on how to get the x-vercel-bypass-secret by re-directing them with the Deeplink cc: @giovaborgogno

- `bugster install` command
This command will be used to handle outside integrations with your Bugster account for users that dont want to switch context setting up the account ( especially during Manual Onboarding) 

Right now the only flag available is --github. This will re-direct the user to the Github App Installation Link. I proposed to add a Terminal re-direction in further iterations after the installation process has been finished successfully.

### Changed
- Destructive Agent Limits
Up to 4 as default. Later on we can parametrize with the subscription tiers
Prioritization of UI crashers instead of Form Destroyers ( FD will run when all UI Crashers are ok)

## [0.3.26]

### Added
- Added  `bugster auth` command for setting up or cleaning existing api key
- Added  `-- parallel` for  `bugster run` command. Accept both  `--parallel` and  `--max-concurrent`

### Changed
- Changed max test limit to 10 

## [0.3.25]

### Changed
- Added platform flags to `bugster init` for faster setup

## [0.3.24]

### Changed
- Added flags to `bugster init` for executing automatically.

## [0.3.23]

### Fixed
- Patch update command.

## [0.3.22]

### Changed
- New architecture for `bugster destructive` unblocking longer executions.

## [0.3.21]

### Added
- Initial monorepo support
  - Works with most monorepo setups including basic Turborepo configurations
  - Detects changes in individual apps within the monorepo
  - Note: Currently does not track changes in shared packages (e.g., common components installed via pnpm in each app's node_modules)

### Changed
- `bugster generate` default settings. You can execute it multiple times, without having to add --force explicitly.
- Improved test generation intelligence: both `bugster generate` and `bugster update` now analyze existing test specs context to avoid creating duplicate or similar tests


## [0.3.20]

### Changed
- Force chromium installation on install script
- Remove the question loop on credentials during `bugster init`

## [0.3.19]

### Changed
- The `--page` flag in `bugster generate` now accepts relative or absolute file paths instead of page folder names. This provides more flexibility and control over which pages are analyzed.
- Added validation for the `--page` flag to ensure that provided paths exist, are files, and have valid JavaScript/TypeScript extensions (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`).

## [0.3.15] - 2025-06-26

### Added
- Added `--stream-results` as the default behaviour for `bugster run`
- Added `--max-concurrent = 5` as the default behaviour for `bugster run`
- Added `--page` for command `bugster generate` for spec generation of a specific page or set of pages.
- Added `--count` option for `bugster generate` to control the number of test specs generated per page (min: 1, max: 30)


## [0.3.14] - 2025-06-26

### Added
- Added Vercel protection bypass to  `bugster destructive`

## [0.3.13] - 2025-06-26

### Added
- Added `run_id` to  `bugster destructive` for test run association

## [0.3.12] - 2025-06-26

### Added
- Added `bugster destructive`, our new agent for raising bugs.

## [0.3.11] - 2025-06-25

### Added
- Added `preferences` section to the configuration file.
- Added `always_run` option to select up to 3 specs that will always run.

## [0.3.10] - 2025-06-24

### Changed
- Improved `bugster generate` architecture, resulting in a 30% speed increase.

## [0.3.9] - 2025-06-23
